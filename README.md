# MY BIKE landing page

[Mockup]([https://www.figma.com/file/50zgLU65Mcd3MisFHMfLfx/POTR-POTS_FE-students?node-id=1760%3A281](https://www.figma.com/file/NZQAIydtHo5QkINyGLHNcq/BIKE-New-Version?node-id=0%3A1))
[Preview](https://MishaLehotskyi.github.io/My-Bike/)

A landing page is implemented strictly according to the design in Figma. The site consists of a header with navigation (on tablets and mobiles, it turns into a dropdown menu), information blocks, and a footer. Links in the header and menu leads to the corresponding blocks of the landing page. All buttons, images, and links have interactive effects. The form has validation to prevent incorrect data. Smooth scrolling helps make the site more pleasant. The speed of animations is the same throughout the landing page. 

It is adaptive for different screens:
  * Desktop > 1024px
  * Tablet > 576px
  * Mobile > 320px

I used:
  * HTML, SCSS, JS
  * BEM
  * flexbox, grid
